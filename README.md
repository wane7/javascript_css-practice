javascript and css practice

Custom template. I like creating custom background templates in general for my practice projects
as well as design reference. More of a visual person, but I love working with javascript, so thats 
where those two meet. The clock at the bottom didn't come out like I wanted it too, along with some 
other features I'm still working on. Another piece of the bigger puzzle. This example is a work in 
progress.
